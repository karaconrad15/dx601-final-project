    "The first 10 columns in the red subset of the Wine dataset are as follows: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, and sulphates. All of these variables are continuous and take on floating point values, meaning there are many possible values the variable could take on within the range between the minimum and maximum amounts of each column. According to the paper from Cortez et al., the fixed acidity column is measured in terms of g(tartaric acid)/dm^3 and may affect a wine's freshness and flavor. Volatile acidity, measured in g(acetic acid)/dm^3, could potentially affect the sweetness of a wine. The citric acid variable (g/dm^3) can be used to adjust the citrus flavor of a given wine. Residual sugar may determine a wine's sweetness and is measured in terms of g/dm^3. Further, chlorides (g(sodium chloride)/dm3) tend to affect the saltiness of wine. Free sulfur dioxide (in mg/dm^3) is used to prevent spoilage in wine. On the other hand, total sulfur dioxide (in mg/dm^3) can prevent oxidaton and maintain a wine's freshness. Density, which is measured in terms of g/cm^3, refers to a wine's properties that affect the flavor and grape quality. PH can affect a wine's flavor, color, and preservation through measuring the strength of acid. A lower pH is ideal in terms of stability and flavor. Finally, sulfates (in g(potassium sulphate)/dm^3) can be used to preserve wine as a preventative measure against spoilage. Overall, the features present in this data set are factors that are utilized to scientifically measure a white wine's comprehensive taste."
